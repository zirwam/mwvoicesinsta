"Muslim Women Voices" is an interactive website that showcases the opinions and accomplishments of Muslim women. A large portion of the media, in today's day and time, portrays Muslim women as weak and oppressed. This project was created to tell an opposing narrative, showing the opinions and strengths of them, instead.
